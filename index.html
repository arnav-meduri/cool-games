Okay I'm Back. Here are a few jokes to keep you entertained...
1. What’s the difference between a  poorly dressed man on a unicycle and a well-dressed man on a bicycle? Attire.
2.How do you know when the moon is broke? When it’s down to its last quarter.
3. How much did the pirate pay for his peg and hook? An arm and a leg.
4. Do you know what stinks about a pirate ship? The poop deck.

  And here comes the best joke...
5. Why did the PowerPoint Presentation cross the road? To get to the other slide.
